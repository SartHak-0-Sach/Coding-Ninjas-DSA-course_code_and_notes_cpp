In this lecture, we have 5 videos talking about the basics of programming and how to get started that have been summarized here, whose code is covered in the code.cpp file, here we go-

So in these lectures we learnt about the basics of programming that were discussed in the previous lecture also, such as variables, loops, conditionals, operators and various types of operators that can be used and data types.

Using above concepts we wrote our first program and tried out these concepts first hand as it is shown in the code file.

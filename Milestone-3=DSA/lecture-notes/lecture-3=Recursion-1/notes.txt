In this set of lectures we will cater to introduction to recursion.

First we started off with what is recursion, why we need it and how to implement it. Then we learned about its basic structure(base case, operation, recursive call)

To understand recursion better we must apply PMI (principle of mathematical induction) that we studied during school.

Rest only approaches on how to solve the given questions were discussed which are given in the solutions folder.
